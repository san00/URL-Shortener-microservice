=========================

Build a fullstack JavaScript app, functionaly similar to [this](https://little-url.herokuapp.com/) and deploy to glitch. Part of the [FCC](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) backend API development projects.

User Story
-----------

* 1. I can pass a URL as a parameter and I will receive a shortened URL in the JSON response.
 
* 2. If I pass an invalid URL that doesn't follow the valid http://www.example.com format, the JSON response will contain an error instead.
 
* 3. When I visit that shortened URL, it will redirect me to my original link.
